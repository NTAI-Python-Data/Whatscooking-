# Recipe Recommendation SystemÂ 
* Created a tool that recommends recipes based on ingredients inputted to help students eat better food.
* Scraped over 4000 recipes from allrecipes.com and jamieoliver.com using python and beautiful soup.
* Parsed recipe ingredients and created word embeddings using Word2Vec and TF-IDF.
* Created a recipe recommendation system using cosine similarity to measure Euclidean distance between the word embeddings of recipe ingredients.
* Built a client-facing API using flask, and a user-friendly app with Streamlit.

## Motivation
Cooking is a hobby for some and a major problem for others. However, you can always use a helping hand for cooking. Being a student, it is always a difficult decision to decide what to eat for lunch or dinner. Sometimes faced with limited items in the kitchen, it is always a challenge to decide what to cook for a meal. This inspired me to create a system that can recommend recipes based on ingredient suggestions.

## Code 
**Python Version:** 3.7  
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, gensim, matplotlib, seaborn, beautifulsoup, flask, streamlit, json, pickle  
**For Web Framework Requirements:**  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```  
**You can run this model yourself using my API:**
```
docker pull jackmleitch/whatscooking:API
docker run -p 5000:5000 -d whatscooking:api
```
