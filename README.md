# Recipe Recommendation SystemÂ 
* Created a tool that recommends recipes based on ingredients inputted to help students eat better food.
* Scraped over 4000 recipes from [All Recipes](allrecipes.com) and [Jamie Oliver](jamieoliver.com) using python and beautiful soup.
* Parsed recipe ingredients and created word embeddings using Word2Vec and TF-IDF.
* Created a recipe recommendation system using cosine similarity to measure Euclidean distance between the word embeddings of recipe ingredients.
* Built a client-facing API using flask, and a user-friendly app with Streamlit.

## Motivation
Cooking is a hobby for some and a major problem for others. However, you can always use a helping hand for cooking. Being a student, it is always a difficult decision to decide what to eat for lunch or dinner. Sometimes faced with limited items in the kitchen, it is always a challenge to decide what to cook for a meal. This inspired me to create a system that can recommend recipes based on ingredient suggestions.

## Code 
**Python Version:** 3.7  
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, gensim, matplotlib, seaborn, beautifulsoup, flask, streamlit, json, pickle  
**For Web Framework Requirements:**  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```  
**You can run this model yourself using my API:**
```
docker pull jackmleitch/whatscooking:API
docker run -p 5000:5000 -d whatscooking:api
```

## Web Scraping
Built a web scraper using [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to scrape over 4000 food recipes from [All Recipes](allrecipes.com) and [Jamie Oliver](jamieoliver.com). With each recipe, I got the following:

* Recipe name 
* Ingredients
* URL
* Rating

## Data Cleaning

After scraping the data, we needed to parse the ingredients to remove redundant information that would not help distinguish recipes. The ingredient parser does the following:
* Lemmatize words to ensure we remove all versions of words, e.g. both pounds and pound
* Removed stopwords 
* Removed cooking measures, e.g. pounds and lbs
* Removed common household items such as oil and butter
